## Simulation of the TeV Blazar Luminosity Function Measured by VERITAS

Code to simulate a VERITAS observing program to measure the luminosity function of TeV HBLs and make a projection of the expected results of this measurement. The sources are selected using the 3HSP catalog ([Chang 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...632A..77C/abstract)), and the measurements are simulated based on the fluxes, spectra, and redshifts reported in [TeVCat](http://tevcat.uchicago.edu/).
